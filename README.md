Mac:
```
docker run --privileged -e USER=neuro -e PASSWORD=neuro --name vnm -v ~/vnm:/vnm -p 6080:80 vnmd/vnm:latest
```
Windows:
```
docker run --privileged -e USER=neuro -e PASSWORD=neuro --name vnm -v C:/vnm:/vnm -p 6080:80 vnmd/vnm:latest
```
Linux:
```
sudo docker run --privileged -e USER=neuro -e PASSWORD=neuro --name vnm -v ~/vnm:/vnm -p 6080:80 vnmd/vnm:latest
```

3. Open a browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:6080
```

4. how to stop container:
```
docker stop vnm
```

5. how to delete container:
